This is an excellent pedagogical approach for a signals and systems course, as it encourages students to move beyond rote memorization and develop a deeper, more integrated understanding of the subject. Your idea of creating two types of knowledge maps is well-supported by research on learning and problem-solving. Here's a breakdown of how you can implement this for your signals and systems course:

## Part 1: The Primitive Knowledge Map

This map is about the "atomic" concepts of the course—the fundamental building blocks. It's a static representation of the core body of knowledge.

1. Identify Core Concepts and Principles:

Begin by outlining all the essential topics in your course. This should be a comprehensive list of all the "nodes" in your map. Examples for signals and systems would include:

- **Signals:** Continuous-time (CT) vs. discrete-time (DT), periodic vs. aperiodic, energy vs. power signals, common signals (unit step, impulse, ramp, sinusoids).
    
- **Systems:** CT vs. DT, linearity, time-invariance, causality, stability.
    
- **Transformations:** Fourier Series, Fourier Transform (CTFT and DTFT), Laplace Transform, Z-Transform.
    
- **Analysis:** Convolution, transfer functions, frequency response, pole-zero plots, sampling theorem.
    
- **Applications:** Filtering (low-pass, high-pass), modulation.
    

2. Define the Relationships ("Edges"):

This is the most crucial part of the primitive map. The "edges" connecting the concepts are the relationships between them. These relationships are the "vehicles" you mentioned. Labeling these connections is key to making the map useful.

- **Cause-and-Effect:** "A linear system _is defined by_ additivity and homogeneity."
    
- **Example/Instance:** "The unit step function _is an example of_ a CT signal."
    
- **Mathematical Equivalence:** "The transfer function H(s) _is the Laplace transform of_ the impulse response h(t)."
    
- **Generalization/Special Case:** "The Fourier Transform _is a generalization of_ the Fourier Series."
    
- **Analysis Tool:** "The pole-zero plot _is used to analyze_ system stability."
    

3. Visual Representation:

You can use a variety of formats, from simple mind maps to more structured concept maps. Encourage students to create their own. The act of building the map is a learning experience in itself.

- **Mind Map:** A central concept (e.g., "Signals and Systems") with branches radiating out for major topics.
    
- **Concept Map:** A hierarchical network with nodes and labeled links. This is often more powerful for technical subjects as it forces students to explicitly state the relationship between concepts.
    
- **Collaborative Whiteboard:** Use a tool like Miro or a physical whiteboard in class to build a shared map with the students.
    

## Part 2: The Problem-Solving Knowledge Map

This map is dynamic and process-oriented. It's a collection of "routes" or problem-solving strategies, each built from a sequence of primitive knowledge. The "vehicles" here are the specific mathematical operations and concepts used to move from one state of knowledge to another.

1. Frame Problems as Gaps:

As you suggested, every problem starts with what's known and ends with what's asked.

- **Starting Point (Knowns):** The given information in the problem. For example, "A system is described by a differential equation." or "The input signal is a sum of sinusoids."
    
- **Ending Point (Asked):** The desired output or conclusion. For example, "Find the output signal y(t)," or "Determine if the system is stable."
    

2. Develop "Routes" and "Vehicles":

The routes are the sequence of steps, and the vehicles are the specific operations (e.g., convolution, Fourier transform, etc.) that connect the knowns to the unknowns. This is where you connect the primitive knowledge to practical application.

- **Route 1: Time Domain Analysis**
    
    - **Starting Point:** System impulse response h(t) and input signal x(t).
        
    - **Vehicle:** Convolution integral: y(t)=∫−∞∞​x(τ)h(t−τ)dτ.
        
    - **Ending Point:** System output y(t).
        
- **Route 2: Frequency Domain Analysis**
    
    - **Starting Point:** System transfer function H(s) and input signal X(s).
        
    - **Vehicle 1:** Multiplication in the frequency domain: Y(s)=X(s)H(s).
        
    - **Vehicle 2:** Inverse Laplace Transform: y(t)=L−1{Y(s)}.
        
    - **Ending Point:** System output y(t).
        
- **Route 3: Stability Analysis**
    
    - **Starting Point:** System transfer function H(s).
        
    - **Vehicle:** Find poles of H(s) by solving for roots of the denominator polynomial.
        
    - **Ending Point:** Conclusion on stability (e.g., "System is stable if all poles are in the left-half of the s-plane").
        

**3. Teaching the Approach:**

- **Model the Process:** During lectures, explicitly "walk the map." When you introduce a problem, identify the starting and ending points. Then, show the students the possible routes (e.g., time domain vs. frequency domain) and the vehicles needed for each step.
    
- **Scaffolded Practice:** Start with simple problems where there is a clear, single best route. Gradually introduce more complex problems where students have to choose between multiple routes.
    
- **"Problem-Solving Checklists" (mini-maps):** For common problem types, have students create small "checklists" or mini-maps. For example, a checklist for "determining system properties" would be: "Test for Linearity (additivity, homogeneity) -> Test for Time-Invariance -> Test for Causality -> Test for Stability."
    
- **Reflective Assignment:** Ask students to solve a problem and then, as a follow-up, write a short paragraph explaining their chosen route and why it was the best choice. This makes them metacognitive about their problem-solving process.
    

## Summary: Your Two Maps

- **Primitive Knowledge Map:** This is the **encyclopedia**. It contains the definitions, properties, and fundamental relationships of all the concepts in the course. It's the reference material.
    
- **Problem-Solving Knowledge Map:** This is the **GPS**. It's the dynamic tool that guides a student through a problem. It helps them identify their current location (the knowns), their destination (the unknowns), and the best path to get there using the "vehicles" of the course.
    

By teaching students to create and use both types of maps, you empower them to not only understand the material but also to think like engineers—strategically and systematically.
